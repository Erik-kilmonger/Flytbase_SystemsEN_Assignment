Explanation:

    Initialization and Takeoff:
        The drone navigation system is initialized with a timeout of 120 seconds.
        The script waits for 3 seconds to ensure the drone interface is properly initialized.
        The argument parser is set up to accept a float value representing the side length of the square.
        The parsed side length value is stored in side_length.
        The drone takes off to a height of 5 meters.

    Flying in a Square:
        The drone moves in a square path based on the provided side length:
            Moves forward by side_length meters.
            Moves right by side_length meters.
            Moves backward by side_length meters.
            Moves left by side_length meters back to the starting point.

    Landing and Shutdown:
        The drone lands.
        The script disconnects from the drone and shuts down the instance.
